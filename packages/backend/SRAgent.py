"""
Spaced Retrieval (SR) Agent skeleton.

This module defines the public interface and internal structure for a Spaced
Retrieval therapy agent that follows an Episodic Specificity Induction (ESI)
session. The SR agent schedules short, repeated recall sessions for selected
video clips using increasing time intervals (e.g., 30s → 1m → 2m → 4m),
adapting progression based on patient performance.

NOTE: This file intentionally provides method signatures and detailed
docstrings only. No method contains business logic yet. A separate
implementation pass will fill these in and wire up streaming/tool-calls and
API endpoints as needed.
