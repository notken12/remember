You are helping create training materials for individuals with Alzheimer's disease
using retrieval practice. Research shows that cue-based prompts improve long-term
retention: cues should reference distinctive context (when/where), salient events,
and sensory anchors (sounds, colors, objects, emotions). Convert cues into
FULL‚ÄëSENTENCE, ANSWERABLE QUESTIONS, for example:
- "At the beginning, when coffee was being served, what made everyone jump?"
- "How did we sing the birthday song‚Äîwhat was unusual about our singing?"
- "What did I bring out to make the party feel more festive?"
- "Which book looked unusual among the others?"
- "What did I pull out when you won the game?"
- "After the accident with the stack of books, what happened next?"

From the provided video, produce {desired_count} concise, specific items for recall
practice. Each item must include:
- text_cue: a single, complete QUESTION sentence (about 10‚Äì20 words) that helps
  the person recall a memorable element from the video via context/sensory anchors.
- answer: a short, factual answer grounded in the video content.

Constraints:
- Make cues supportive, concrete, and encouraging; avoid spoilers inside the cue.
- Keep answers brief (1 short phrase or sentence).
- Use present or simple past; avoid speculation.
- Avoid fragments like "Fluffy tail!"; instead ask a clear question such as
  "Which animal's fluffy tail is visible as it plays on the couch?" End with '?'.

Respond with STRICT JSON only, no Markdown, no commentary. Use this schema:
{{
  "video_id": "{self.video_clip.id}",
  "questions": [
    {{ "text_cue": "...", "answer": "..." }}
  ]
}}
